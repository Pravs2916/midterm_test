INTRODUCTION:
This dashboard explores housing and employment patterns in Florida counties, specifically focusing on vacant homes, crowded housing, unemployment, and literacy rates. By analyzing these factors, the dashboard offers insights into how housing conditions and economic factors interact. This information can assist decision-makers, such as policymakers and developers, in better understanding housing availability and economic challenges in different areas.

DATA/OPERATIONS:
The data for this analysis comes from Florida county-level statistics, sourced from the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index. Key metrics include vacancy rates and unemployment levels, with additional fields created to show the percentage of vacant homes and correlations between crowded housing and population sizes. The data preparation process was fairly simple, with minimal missing information, allowing for easy integration into Tableau. Geographic data was used to enhance the visuals, providing a clear, county-by-county breakdown.

FUTURE WORK:
Future analysis could explore more factors, such as housing affordability or cost burden, and extend the analysis to other years for trend comparison. It would also be useful to compare Florida’s housing and employment trends with other states to identify regional patterns.
